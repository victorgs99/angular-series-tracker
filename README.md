# angular-series-tracker
Application that allows the user to keep track of the series they are currently watching.

## Summary
The objective is that the user has an application that allows him to keep track of the series he is currently watching. It is also possible to add series that are on the waiting list or that have already finished their broadcast, the application will make a record of them.

Although nowadays many streaming/video platforms have their own series log, the main idea is that this application serves as a tracker for all series, regardless of their platform. 

### Features
- **Add series.** The user can add as many series as he wants.
- **Series management.** An added series can modify its information, add chapter records and even delete the series.
- **Series classification.** An added series can be classified as: waiting list, currently watching and terminated.

The Angular framework was used for the frontend development of this project, the backend was developed with Express.js.
